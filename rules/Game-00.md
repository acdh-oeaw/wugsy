# Game -00 Single Player

>Game is based on following idea: "Participants typically recall as many items from long-term memory as they can within a minute or two.
The number of responses serves as a standard measure of semantic fluency, and items tend to be recalled in semantic, within-category
clusters. For instance, for the category “animals,” a number of farm animals might be recalled first, followed by a set of house pets,
then sea creatures, and so on. This pattern of behavior suggests that semantic memory is effectively clustered with respect to this
recall task, and analyses of inter-response intervals (IRIs) corroborate this hypothesis—IRIs are shorter within clusters vs. between
clusters"

1. By playing this game we get information about our players (semantic fluency), which can be used for the analysis or the trust/scoring
system (ethical issues? :)
2. Game delivers Data for game00 "Mind Trees": By answering Questions (e.g. what food is served at a wedding) player add data used
for the (25) cards in game_00. This means the added words are in a cultural context and can be operationalized in Game00 as a addition the DBÖ data.
